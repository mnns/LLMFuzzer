## 🌟 Features

- Robust fuzzing for LLMs 🧪
- LLM API integration testing 🛠️
- Wide range of fuzzing strategies 🌀
- Modular architecture for easy extendability 📚

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnns/LLMFuzzer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd LLMFuzzer
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Edit **llmfuzzer.cfg** with your LLM API endpoint (LLMFuzzer -> Your Application -> LLM)
```bash
Connection: 
  Type: HTTP-API
  Url: "http://localhost:3000/chat" # Your LLM API
  Content: JSON
  Query-Attribute: "query" # Your JSON query attribute
  Output-Attribute: "answer" # Your JSON response attribute
  Headers: {'enwiki_session': '17ab96bd8ffbe8ca58a78657a918558'} # Add HTTP Headers if needed 
  Cookie: {'enwiki_session': '17ab96bd8ffbe8ca58a78657a918558'} # Add Cookies if needed
```

5. Run LLMFuzzer
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔥 Roadmap
* Adding more attacks
* HTML Report as output
* Multiple Connectors (JSON-POST, RAW-POST, QUERY-GET)
* Multiple Comparers
* Proxy Support
* Dual-LLM (Side LLM observation)
* Autonomous Attack Mode
